# Notes - Linux Command Line Basics (Bash)

## About

* You can find the info in the Wiki part of this Repository. I only left the README.md here to give a hint where the Notes are. 
* These Notes are written for my own support, because I don't use Linux command line on a daily basis so it will be a reminder for me when I have to use it. On the other hand I place it on GitHub for 2 reasons: 
..* 1 It is easy to acces from everywhere without login
..* 2 Maybe someone find it useful
